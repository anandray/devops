## gofountain

Go implementation of various fountain codes.
Luby Transform, Online codes, Raptor code.

Includes many tests, libraries, and utilities.

The abstraction level is "low" -- that is, the code currently supports very low-level
encoder/decoder level functionality, without any packetizing, etc. that a full system
would include on top of this layer.
